We need 4 files: stribog.c, types.h, stribog_data.h, string.h. 
They should be in the same solution and in the same project. 
You can even just create them yourself and copy the code. 
The program calculates the hash for two messages specified inside the program. Messages are represented by fixed-length arrays, the elements of which are 8-bit numbers in the 16-bit number system. 
They are located in the stribog.c file. 
To change the input messages, you need to change the size of the array and the elements themselves. 
Or make another implementation of data entry and transformation)
